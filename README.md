## Project Overview: Food Image Classification with TensorFlow

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to recognize different types of food from images using the **Food-101 dataset**, which includes over 100,000 images categorized into **101 food classes**.

### What the Project Does

1. **Loads and explores** the Food-101 dataset using TensorFlow Datasets.
2. **Preprocesses images** by resizing and normalizing them to prepare for model training.
3. **Builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify food images based on their visual features.
4. **Trains the model** on the dataset, tuning it to identify patterns across various food categories.
5. **Evaluates the model’s performance** using accuracy and loss metrics.
6. **Tests the model** with real or random samples to visualize how well it can predict food types.

### Outcome

- Successfully trained a CNN model capable of identifying food types from images.
- Achieved **moderate to high accuracy**, indicating the model learned useful features.
- The project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to image-based classification tasks in food recognition—useful for apps in diet tracking, restaurant recommendations, or culinary AI.
